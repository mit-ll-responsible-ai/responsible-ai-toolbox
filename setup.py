DESCRIPTION = "PyTorch-centric library for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of AI technologies"
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
The rAI-toolbox is designed to enable methods for evaluating and enhancing both the
robustness and the explainability of AI models in a way that is scalable and that
composes naturally with other popular ML frameworks.

A key design principle of the rAI-toolbox is that it adheres strictly to the APIs
specified by the PyTorch machine learning framework. For example, the rAI-toolbox frames
adversarial training workflows solely in terms of the `torch.nn.Optimizer` and
`torch.nn.Module` APIs. This makes it trivial to leverage other libraries and
frameworks from the PyTorch ecosystem to bolster your responsible AI R&D. For
instance, one can naturally leverage the rAI-toolbox together with
PyTorch Lightning to perform distributed adversarial training.
