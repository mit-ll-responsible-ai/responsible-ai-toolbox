# Reproduce Results From Madry Lab's Robustness Toolbox

This experiment takes pre-trained robust models developed at [MadryLab](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness) and reproduces results for CIFAR-10 and [Restricted ImageNet](https://github.com/MadryLab/robust_representations) datasets. For CIFAR-10, we aim to reproduce the results for the $\ell_2$-norm shown in this [README](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness/blob/master/README.rst). For Restricted ImageNet we want to reproduce the results shown in shown in Appendix A.4 from https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00945.

The pretrained models for this experiment can be found here(WILL ADD LINK LATER):

  - `mitll_cifar_l2_1_0`: A simplified data structure of the pre-trained model available via the [README](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness/blob/master/README.rst). This is a ResNet-50 model trained with Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) using the $\ell_2$-norm with $\epsilon=1.0$
  - `mitll_restricted_imagenet_l2_3_0`: TA simplified data structure of the pre-trained model available via the [README](https://github.com/MadryLab/robust_representations/blob/master/README.md).  This is a ResNet-50 model trained with PGD using the $\ell_2$-norm with $\epsilon=3.0$.

## Exeperiments


### CIFAR10

Reproduce last column of "CIFAR10 L2-robust accuracy" table from https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness by executing PGD with multiple $\epsilon$ values and the robustly trained ResNet-50 model.  These results are for 20-step PGD with step size of `2.5 * Îµ-test / num_steps`.

Experiment Configurations:
    - standard: standard training (full dataset)
    - robust: adversarial training (full dataset)
    - standard_fast: standard training with only 100 examples
    - robust_fast: adversarial training with only 100 examples

1. CPU (single process)

```bash
$ python madry.py +experiment=standard_fast
standard [tensor(0.9570), tensor(0.1063), tensor(0.0216), tensor(0.), tensor(0.)]

$ python madry.py +experiment=robust_fast
robust [tensor(0.8251), tensor(0.7855), tensor(0.6789), tensor(0.4522), tensor(0.1719)]
```

2. Torch Distributed (2 GPU)

```bash
$ torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 madry.py +experiment=standard_fast
standard [tensor(0.9570, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.0895, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.0091, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0., device='cuda:0'), tensor(0., device='cuda:0')]

$ torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 madry.py +experiment=standard_fast
robust [tensor(0.8251, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.7855, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.6726, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.4431, device='cuda:0'), tensor(0.1719, device='cuda:0')]
```

#### Results

|Test-eps | Expected | rai_toolbox    |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| 0.0     | 82       | 82             |
| 0.25    | 76       | 76             |
| 0.5     | 69       | 69             |
| 1.0     | 53       | 53             |
| 2.0     | 15       | 19             |

Small difference for $\epsilon=2.0$.
