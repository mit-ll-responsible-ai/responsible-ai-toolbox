def jensen_shannon_divergence(
    *probs: ArrayLike, weight: Optional[float] = None
) -> tr.Tensor:
    r"""
    Computes the Jensen-Shannon divergence [1]_ between n distributions:

    :math:`JSD(P_1, P_2, ..., P_n)`

    This loss is symmetric and is bounded by :math:`0 <= JSD(P_1, P_2, ..., P_n) <= \ln(n)`

    Parameters
    ----------
    probs : ArrayLike, shape-(N, D)
        A collection of n probability distributions. Each conveys of batch of N
        distributions over D categories.

    weight : Optional[float]
        A scaling factor that will be applied to the consistency loss.


    Returns
    -------
    loss : tr.Tensor, shape-(,)
        The scalar loss computed via the batch-mean.

    Notes
    -----
    The JSD loss is computed for each corresponding n-tuple of distributions and
    the batch-mean is ultimately returned.

    Examples
    --------
    Let's measure the divergence between three discrete distributions of length-two.

    >>> from rai_toolbox.losses import jensen_shannon_divergence
    >>> P1 = [[0.0, 1.0]]
    >>> P2 = [[1.0, 0.0]]
    >>> P3 = [[0.5, 0.5]]
    >>> jensen_shannon_divergence(P1, P2, P3)
    tensor(0.4621)

    The divergence is symmetric.

    >>> jensen_shannon_divergence(P1, P3, P2)
    tensor(0.4621)
