    Augments `datum` using a mixture of randomly-composed augmentations via a method
    called "AugMix" [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datum : T1
       The datum to be augmixed.

    num_aug_chains : int
        The number of independent "augmentation chains" that are used to produce the augmixed
        result.

    aug_chain_depth : Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]
        Determines that number of augmentations that are randomly sampled (with replacement) and
        composed to form each augmentation chain.

        If a tuple of values are provided, these are used as the lower (inclusive) and
        upper (exclusive) bounds on a uniform integer-valued distribution from which the depth
        will be sampled for each augmentation chain.

        E.g.,

        - `mixture_depth=2` means that each augmentation chain will consist of two (randomly sampled) augmentations composed together.
        - `aug_chain_depth=(1, 4)` means depth of any given augmentation chain is uniformly sampled from [1, 4).

    process_fn : Callable[[T1], T2]
        The preprocessing function applied to the both clean and augmixed datums before
        they are combined. The return type of `process_fn` determines the return type
        of `augment_and_mix`.

    augmentations : Sequence[Callable[[T1], T1]]
        The collection of datum augmentations that is sampled from (with replacement) to form each augmentation
        chain.

    beta_params : Tuple[float, float]
        The Beta distribution parameters to draw `m`, which weights that convex combination::

                (1 - m) * img_process_fn(datum) + m * img_process_fn(augment(datum))

        If a single value is specified, it is used as both parameters for the distribution.

    dirichlet_params : Union[float, Sequence[float]]
        The Dirichlet distribution parameters used to weight the `mixture_width` number of augmentation chains.
        If a sequence is provided, its length must match `num_aug_chains`.

    augmentation_choice_probs : Optional[Sequence[float]]
        The probabilities associated with sampling each respective entry in `augmentations`.
        If not specified, a uniform distribution over all entries of `augmentation`.

    Returns
    -------
    augmixed: T2
        The augmixed datum.

    Notes
    -----
    The following depicts AugMix with N augmentation chains. Each `augchain(...)` consists of
    composed augmentations, where the composition depth is determined by `mixture_depth`::

        (1 - m) * process_fn(img) + m * (w1 * (process_fn ∘ augchain1)(img) + ... + wN * (process_fn ∘ augchainN)(img))

    with

    - m ~ Beta
    - [w1, ..., wN] ~ Dirichlet

    Random values are drawn via NumPy's global random number generator. Thus `numpy.random.seed`
    must be set in order to obtain reproducible results. Note that, until
    PyTorch 1.9.0, there was an issue with using NumPy's global RNG in conjunction with
    DataLoaders that used multiple workers, where identical seeds were being used
    across workers and the same seed was being set at the outset of each epoch.
