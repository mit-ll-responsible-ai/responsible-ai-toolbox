Welcome to the documentation for the responsible AI toolbox
===========================================================

`rai_toolbox` is designed to enable methods for evaluating and enhancing both the 
robustness and the explainability of AI models in a way that is scalable and that 
composes naturally with other popular ML frameworks.

A key design principle of the rAI-toolbox is that it adheres strictly to the APIs 
specified by the PyTorch machine learning framework. For example, the rAI-toolbox frames 
adversarial training workflows solely in terms of the `torch.nn.Optimizer` and 
`torch.nn.Module` APIs. This makes it trivial to leverage other libraries and 
frameworks from the PyTorch ecosystem to bolster your responsible AI R&D. For 
instance, one can naturally leverage the rAI-toolbox together with
[PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) to perform distributed 
adversarial training.

To see `rai_toolbox` in action, please refer to [`examples/`](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/responsible-ai-toolbox/tree/main/examples) and [`experiments/`](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/responsible-ai-toolbox/tree/main/experiments).
